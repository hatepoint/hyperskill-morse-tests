<h2><strong>Stage 1: Designing App UI</strong></h2>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>In this initial phase, the goal is to establish a visually intuitive and functional interface for users to interact with the Morse code translation application. The design process involves crafting a layout that neatly organizes input and output fields and buttons to work with the application.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Create a layout that includes:</p>

<ol>
    <li>An EditText&nbsp;with an id of <code>et_text</code>&nbsp;for users to enter text that will be translated to morse.</li>
    <li>An EditText with an id of <code>et_morse</code> to display the translated text or entering a Morse code.</li>
    <li>A button with an id of <code>bt_clear</code> to clear both EditTexts.</li>
    <li>A button with an id of <code>bt_guide</code> that will be used to open an activity with&nbsp;alphabet and an instruction for the app.</li>
    <li>A TextView&nbsp;with an id of <code>tv_text</code> with a &quot;Text&quot; set as a text and placed near the <code>et_text</code>&nbsp;EditText</li>
    <li>A TextView with an id of <code>tv_morse</code>&nbsp;with a &quot;Morse&quot; set as a text and placed near the <code>et_morse</code>&nbsp;EditText</li>
</ol>

<p>No actions are required for this stage, just define the Layout with correct ID&#39;s and Views.</p>
